# Estimating Group-Specific Contributions to Life-Table Functions

The decomposition of demographic measures is a fundamental tool in a demographerâ€™s toolkit. Through decomposition of demographic measures, researchers can gain crucial insights into the importance of different mechanisms in producing demographic change. Most decomposition techniques decompose changes in demographic measures over time or, more generally, differences between demographic rates. However, fewer techniques are available to researchers needing to estimate the contribution of different subpopulations to a demographic measure for the total population. This paper develops such a decomposition technique and discusses one practical application. A full description of this approach is developed in the manuscript "Groupwise-Decomposition".

## Structure of the Repository

- Groupwise-Decomposition.pdf: describes the decomposition, proves some of its property, and shows an example application. All the content should be considered preliminary at this stage.
- /R: contains RMarkdown notebooks to replicate the results of the paper.
- /data: contains the data needed to replicate the results of the paper (/input) and the resulting estimates (/output).
- /figures: contains the figures generated by the R code.
