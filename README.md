# Estimating Group-Specific Contributions to Life-Table Functions

The decomposition of demographic measures is a fundamental tool in a demographerâ€™s toolkit. Through decomposition of demographic measures, researchers can gain crucial insights into the importance of different mechanisms in producing demographic change. Most decomposition techniques decompose changes in demographic measures over time or, more generally, differences between demographic rates. However, fewer techniques are available to researchers needing to estimate the contribution of different subpopulations to a demographic measure for the total population. This paper develops such a decomposition technique and discusses one practical application. The extended abstract I submitted for the 2024 PAA (NG-decomposition-PAA.pdf) offers more details.
